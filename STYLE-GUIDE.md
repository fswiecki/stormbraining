### Indentation

When writing any block of code that is logically subordinate to the line immediately before and after it, that block should be indented two spaces more than the surrounding lines

* Do not put any tab characters anywhere in your code. You would do best to stop pressing the tab key entirely.
* Increase the indent level for all blocks by two extra spaces
    * When a line opens a block, the next line starts 2 spaces further in than the line that opened
    * When a line closes a block, that line starts at the same level as the line that opened the block
